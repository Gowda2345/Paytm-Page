<p>Throughout his career, Punith Rajkumar has achieved remarkable success...
  1976–1989: As child actor
  Director V. Somashekar cast Puneeth (then known as Lohith) onscreen when he was six months old in his
   thriller film Premada Kanike (1976).[16][17] This was followed by Vijay's Sanaadi Appanna (1977), 
   based on Krishnamoorthy Puranik's novel of the same name,[18] when Puneeth was one year old. 
   Thayige Thakka Maga (1978) was again directed by V. Somashekar and starred his father. Two years later, 
   directors Dorai–Bhagavan cast him as Shyam in Vasantha Geetha (1980). This was followed by
    K. S. L. Swamy's
    mythological drama Bhoomige Banda Bhagavantha (1981, appearing as Lord Krishna) and
     B. S. Ranga's Bhagyavantha (1982),[19] in which he recorded his first popular song:
      "Baana Daariyalli Soorya", composed by T. G. Lingappa. That year, he appeared in two
